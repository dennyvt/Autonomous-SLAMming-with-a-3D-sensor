# Autonomous-SLAMming-with-a-3D-sensor
School project with Mattijs Kok and Jeroen Koster


Assignment:
Autonomous SLAMming of an unknown environment
• A 3D sensor must be used (e.g., lidar or depth camera)
• After SLAMming, the robot must return to a specific pose
• Simulation in Gazebo

For this assignment, you will have to autonomously drive through a simulated world to create a map. 
Students will be asked to create a robot with a 3D sensor (e.g., lidar or depth camera). This robot will then 
have to drive through a world in Gazebo, mapping it as it goes. After it is finished mapping, it will have to 
go to a beforehand designated pose.
